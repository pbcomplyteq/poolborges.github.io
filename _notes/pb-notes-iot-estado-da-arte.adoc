==== Zigbee Cluster Library (ZCL).

Door Lock Cluster 

At the application layer, 
Zigbee provides a standardized communication protocol through entities called “clusters.” 
Clusters define what commands a device can send or receive, 
and what pieces of data or attributes a device cares about. 
The Door Lock Cluster defines everything from how a door is locked and unlocked to schedules and pin codes for the lock. Thus, at the absolute top of the Zigbee protocol stack, a door lock has a very specific and standardized way that it communicates with the rest of the Zigbee network and the outside world.

=== ZWave

Products

=== Dotdot

Dotdot is based on the Zigbee Cluster Library (ZCL) 


The core of the dotdot language is the zigbee interoperability layer, 
but without the protocol. A layer comprises a protocol, interface, 
and service (the action that the layer performs). 
The dotdot language is agnostic to underlying networks and protocol message structure, 
so it defines only the interface and the action. Hence, it is an interaction model, 
defining the behavior and interaction between devices.

For each qualified network, a dotdot specification will also standardize 
or recommend protocols to complete the application layer
For example, a dotdot device on a zigbee network uses 
standard ZCL APS messages (and defines the format). 
A dotdot device on an IP network uses standard ZCLIP URI messages.


Organization: DSR, MMB Networks, NXP Semiconductors, Silicon Labs, and Ubilogix.

=== Wireless M-BUS

A radio variant of M-Bus (Wireless M-Bus) is also specified in EN 13757-4. The M-Bus was developed to fill the need for a system for the networking and remote reading of utility meters, for example to measure the consumption of gas or water in the home.

Wireless M-Bus is the European standard for wireless meter communication with gas, electric, water and heat meters (EN 13757).

The Silicon Labs wireless M-Bus software and stack provide: Fully compliant wireless M-Bus protocol stack. Worldwide wireless M-Bus support with modes and configurations 868 MHz modes S1, S1-m, S2, T1, T2, C1, C2.
