----
HART device runs on 4-20 mA signal as base and digital information is 
modulated on it using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation technique 
as 2100 Hz as "0" and 1200 Hz as "1" to be read at the demodulator/receiver.
----

The **HART Protocol** implements layers 1,2, 3, 4 and 7 of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) 7-layer protocol model: The HART Physical Layer is based on the Bell 202 standard, using frequency shift keying (FSK) to communicate at 1200 bps. The signal frequencies representing bit values of 0 and 1 are 2200 and 1200Hz respectively.

Network Caracterization

* Type of Network: Device (Process Automation)
* Physical Media: 
** 4-20 mA analog instrumentation wiring 
** 2.4 GHz wireless
* Network Topology: One-on-One, multidrop, wireless mesh

----
We standardize semantic data models and web
services with the goal of making it easier to unlock value from the vast quantity
of data being generated by the smart devices that permeate our homes, buildings,
factories, and cities. Applications include automation, control, energy, HVAC,
lighting, and other environmental systems.
